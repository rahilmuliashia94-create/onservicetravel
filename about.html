  <h2>About On Service Travel Consultants (OSTC)</h2>
  <p>
    On Service Travel Consultants (OSTC) is a Government of India–authorized overseas manpower
    recruitment and workforce deployment firm headquartered in Rajkot, Gujarat.

<!-- WHO WE ARE -->
<section class="section reveal">
  <h2>Who We Are</h2>
  <p>
    OSTC is not a typical visa or travel agent.
    We operate as a full-cycle international recruitment partner,
    managing everything from candidate screening and trade testing
    to visa processing, legal compliance, and post-deployment support.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our core objective is simple and uncompromising:
    to create legal, ethical, and sustainable overseas employment opportunities
    for Indian workers while delivering reliable manpower solutions
    to global employers.

  <h2>What Makes OSTC Different</h2>

  <div class="grid">

    <div class="card">
      <h3>1. Government Authorization & Legal Compliance</h3>
      <p>
        OSTC operates strictly under Indian Emigration Act regulations and
        adheres to destination-country labor laws.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every deployment is contract-verified, salary-transparent,
        embassy-compliant, and free from illegal brokerage practices.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not process fake job offers, tourist-to-work conversions,
        or unauthorized middlemen transactions.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>2. End-to-End Recruitment Model</h3>
      <p>
        Most agencies stop at visa stamping. OSTC goes further.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our services include candidate sourcing & verification,
        trade testing, language orientation, medical & police clearance coordination,
        visa documentation, employer liaison, flight booking,
        and post-arrival coordination.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>3. In-House Training & Trade Testing – Rajkot</h3>
      <p>
        Our Rajkot Training Center ensures candidates are job-ready before departure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Training includes trade-specific skill validation,
        safety standards, worksite behavior,
        basic English or country-specific language exposure,
        and cultural expectations education.
      </p>
      <p>
        This reduces rejection risk and improves employer satisfaction.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>4. Zero-Exploitation Policy</h3>
      <p>
        OSTC follows a strict Ethical Recruitment Charter.
      </p>
      <p>
        No illegal fees. No document confiscation.
        No false salary promises. No contract substitution.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every candidate receives a written job contract,
        full salary explanation, and legal exit clearance guidance.
