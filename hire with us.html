        <h2>Labour Market Impact & Domestic Recruitment</h2>
        
        <div class="sub-section">
            <h3>1.1 The Statutory 30-Day Market Test</h3>
            <div class="content-body">
                In the current 2026 regulatory environment, the <b>Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA)</b> is no longer a simple application; it is a forensic audit of a company’s recruitment efforts. Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) requires that every employer demonstrate a "best-effort" search for Canadian citizens and Permanent Residents before looking abroad.
                <br><br>
                OSTC manages the entire <b>Mandatory Recruitment Period</b>. This begins with a 30-day posting on the National Job Bank. Under new 2026 directives, simply posting the ad is insufficient. Our compliance team must utilize the "Job Match" tool to invite every candidate with a 4-star rating or higher to apply. If a Canadian candidate applies and is rejected, we must document the objective, non-discriminatory reasons for that rejection. Failure to provide this <b>Recruitment Summary Report</b> is the #1 cause for a Negative LMIA. 
                <br><br>
                We also deploy the ad on two additional platforms of national or regional scope. For <b>NOC 73300 (Transport Truck Drivers)</b>, we utilize specialized logistics boards; for <b>NOC 85100 (Livestock Labourers)</b>, we target regional agricultural communities. This multi-layered approach ensures your business satisfies the "Market Test" and protects your $1,000 CAD government processing fee from being wasted on a refusal.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="tech-panel">
            <h4><span class="form-tag">TEER 0-5</span> Wage Integrity & Audit Defense</h4>
            <p>We perform a technical audit of your payroll data against the 2026 <b>Median Prevailing Wage</b> for your specific Economic Region. Under the <i>Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR)</i>, if the wage offered is even $0.10 below the Job Bank median, the application is automatically disqualified. OSTC verifies your wage offer against current CRA payroll standards to ensure perfect alignment.</p>

        <h2>Source Integrity & Indian Operations</h2>
        
        <div class="sub-section">
            <h3>2.1 Mitigating "Section 40" Legal Risks</h3>
            <div class="content-body">
                The greatest risk to a Canadian employer is <b>Misrepresentation</b> under Section 40 of the IRPA. If a candidate provides a fake diploma or a forged experience letter, the employer—not just the worker—can be banned from the TFWP for up to 5 years. OSTC operates a <b>Zero-Fraud Pipeline</b> in India to eliminate this liability.
                <br><br>
                Our Indian operations center verifies every <b>Passport Seva Kendra (PSK)</b> issued Police Clearance Certificate via QR-tracking. We do not accept local station letters. Furthermore, all skilled trade candidates (Mechanics, Welders, Drivers) undergo practical testing at our <b>Rajkot Trade Test Facility</b>. We don't just check resumes; we verify that they can operate the machinery and follow the safety protocols required by Canadian WSIB and Provincial Labour boards.
                <br><br>
                This "ground-level" verification includes physical calls to previous employers in India to verify tenure, salary, and job duties. We provide the Canadian employer with a <b>Candidate Integrity Attestation</b>, which serves as a powerful shield during any subsequent Service Canada compliance review or unannounced site inspection.

        <div class="sub-section">
            <h3>3.1 Visa Stamping & Port of Entry (POE)</h3>
            <div class="content-body">
                Once a Positive LMIA is secured, the file moves to <b>Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC)</b>. We manage the submission of the <b>Work Permit Made Outside of Canada (IMM 1295)</b>. This includes the <b>Schedule 1 (IMM 5257)</b> and <b>Family Information (IMM 5645)</b> forms.
                <br><br>
                OSTC handles the logistics of biometrics collection at <b>VFS Global</b> centers across India. We also conduct "Entry Briefings" for our workers. They are trained on how to present their documents at the Canadian Port of Entry (POE) to the CBSA officer. This minimizes the risk of a "216(1) refusal"—the most common reason workers are turned back, which happens when an officer isn't satisfied the worker will leave Canada at the end of their contract. We ensure the worker understands their <b>Dual Intent</b> rights while remaining fully compliant with their work permit conditions.

            <h4 style="color: var(--can-red);">The 10% Workforce Cap Rule (2026 Update)</h4>
            <p>In 2026, the 10% cap on Temporary Foreign Workers in the Low-Wage stream is strictly monitored. Additionally, LMIA applications in the Low-Wage stream are being refused in areas where the <b>unemployment rate is 6% or higher</b>. OSTC provides an "Economic Area Audit" to see if your business qualifies for the 20% exception (Construction/Food Processing) or the Primary Agriculture exemption.</p>

        <div class="sub-section">
            <h3>4.1 Audit Readiness & Document Retention</h3>
            <div class="content-body">
                Hiring a foreign worker is a 6-year commitment to compliance. Under the <i>Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations</i>, you must keep all records for 6 years from the worker's first day of work. OSTC provides you with a <b>Compliance Portfolio</b> for every hire.
                <br><br>
                This portfolio includes the initial job ads, the recruitment summary, the signed <b>Employment Agreement</b> (which must be provided to the worker in their preferred language—English or French), and proof of the $1,000 LMIA fee payment. For <b>Primary Agriculture</b> and <b>Low-Wage</b> streams, we also assist in coordinating <b>Housing Inspections</b>. Federal law requires that the employer provide "Suitable and Affordable" housing. We ensure your housing meets municipal and federal safety standards before the worker arrives, shielding you from massive fines and the "TFWP Blacklist."
