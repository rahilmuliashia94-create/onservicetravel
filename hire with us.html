    <h1>Strategic Global Hiring Manual</h1>
    <p>A comprehensive technical framework for Canadian employers navigating the 2026 TFWP and LMIA compliance landscape.</p>
</section>

<div class="content-wrapper">

    <section class="manual-section">
        <h2>I. Domestic Labour Market Testing & ESDC Compliance</h2>
        <div class="technical-grid">
            <div class="detail-text">
                The foundational requirement for any <b>Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA)</b> is the verification that no Canadian citizen or Permanent Resident is available for the role. In 2026, Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) has intensified its audit of the "Mandatory Recruitment Period." OSTC manages this entire 30-day lifecycle with forensic precision. 
                <br><br>
                We execute the mandatory <b>Job Bank</b> posting, but more importantly, we manage the <b>"Job Match" tool</b>. Service Canada now requires employers to actively invite every "4-star" and "5-star" candidate within the Job Bank system. If an employer ignores these candidates, the LMIA will be refused for lack of recruitment effort. We provide you with a <b>Recruitment Summary Report</b> that documents every interaction, interview, and the technical, non-discriminatory reason for every non-selection. This report is your primary defense in a government audit.
            </div>
            <div class="detail-text">
                Beyond Job Bank, we utilize two additional <b>National Scope</b> recruitment methods. Whether it is <b>NOC 73300 (Transport Truck Drivers)</b> or <b>NOC 85100 (Livestock Labourers)</b>, we place ads on high-traffic platforms like Indeed, LinkedIn, and sector-specific boards. 
                <br><br>
                Our <b>Wage Integrity Audit</b> ensures that your offered salary meets the 2026 <b>Median Hourly Wage</b> for your specific Economic Region. Under-offering by even $0.10 will lead to an immediate refusal. We ensure that your internal payroll matches the <b>CRA T4</b> data and the LMIA offer to prevent "Wage Non-Compliance" penalties. This is not just hiring; it is risk management.

        <h2>II. Source Integrity & Indian Verification Protocols</h2>
        <div class="info-callout">
            <h3>Mitigating "Section 40" Misrepresentation</h3>
            <p class="detail-text">
                One of the most dangerous risks for a Canadian employer is a worker providing a fake document. Under <b>Section 40 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA)</b>, this is considered misrepresentation. If a worker is found with fake documents, the employer can be banned from the TFWP for up to 5 years. <b>OSTC kills this risk at the source.</b> 
                <br><br>
                In India, we exclusively process <b>PSK-PCC (Passport Seva Kendra)</b> police clearances, which are verifiable via federal QR codes. We do not accept local police letters. Furthermore, we conduct physical <b>"Ground Verification"</b> of experience letters. Our team calls previous Indian employers to verify salary history and tenure. For skilled trades, we put candidates through practical testing at our <b>Rajkot Center</b>. If a candidate says they are a "Heavy Duty Mechanic," they must prove it in our workshop before their resume is sent to your desk.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="technical-grid">
            <div class="detail-text">
                <b>Identity Verification:</b> We cross-check every candidate's Aadhar (National ID) and Passport against their employment history. This ensures that the person you interview via Zoom is the exact person who arrives at the airport. 
            </div>
            <div class="detail-text">
                <b>Medical Pre-Screening:</b> We coordinate "Upfront Medicals" with <b>IRCC-authorized Panel Physicians</b>. By screening for health issues early, we prevent the "Medical Inadmissibility" delays that often stall deployments for months.
            </div>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section class="manual-section">
        <h2>III. The IRCC Deployment Lifecycle</h2>
        <div class="detail-text">
            Once the Positive LMIA is in hand, the file transitions to <b>Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC)</b>. OSTC manages the <b>Form IMM 1295 (Work Permit)</b> and the <b>Employer Portal</b> filing. We ensure that the $230 CAD Employer Compliance Fee is paid and the Offer of Employment is submitted via the GCKey portal with 100% accuracy.
            <br><br>
            A critical part of our service is the <b>Port of Entry (POE) Briefing</b>. We prepare our workers on how to present their work permit approval to CBSA officers. We train them to clearly articulate their job duties and their intent to return to India upon the permit's expiration—addressing <b>Section 216(1)</b> concerns about "Dual Intent." This prevents workers from being turned away at the Canadian border.

        <div class="info-callout" style="border-left: 5px solid var(--primary-red);">
            <h3>2026 Policy Update: The 6% Unemployment Rule</h3>
            <p class="detail-text">
                Effective 2026, IRCC refuses Low-Wage LMIA applications in census metropolitan areas where the unemployment rate is <b>6% or higher</b>. OSTC performs a "Regional Audit" of your business location before you apply. If you are in a refusal zone, we provide the strategy to pivot to the <b>High-Wage Stream</b> or <b>Primary Agriculture Stream</b>, which are exempt from these refusal rules.

        <h2>IV. Employer Post-Arrival Obligations & Audit Defense</h2>
        <div class="technical-grid">
            <div class="detail-text">
                Your legal commitment to the TFWP does not end when the worker arrives. You are required to maintain a <b>Compliance Binder</b> for 6 years. This must include pay stubs showing the correct hourly rate, proof of transportation (if applicable), and housing inspection reports. 
                <br><br>
                For <b>Agriculture and Low-Wage</b> streams, we assist you in meeting the "Suitable and Affordable Housing" requirement. We help coordinate municipal inspections to ensure your worker housing meets the federal standard, protecting you from massive fines or a TFWP blacklist.
            </div>
            <div class="detail-text">
                <b>Payroll Integrity:</b> We work with your accounting team to ensure that <b>CRA deductions</b> (CPP, EI) are handled correctly for foreign workers. During a Service Canada inspection, the officer will compare your payroll logs to the original LMIA. OSTC ensures these documents match perfectly, so your business remains in good standing with the government.
